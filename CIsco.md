NIC= Network Interface Card (usually physically connects to the end devices)
physical port= media connect to the end devices.
Interface=specialized port on a networking device that connect to individual networks.

**The terms port and interface are often used interchangeably.

-logical topology diagram-(one can see which end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.)

*1. A NIC is a specialized port on a networking device that connects to individual networks.
2. An interface physically connects the end device to the network.
3. The logical topology lets you see which end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.
4. The physical topology lets you see the actual location of intermediary devices and cable installation.*


LAN:1.LANs interconnect end devices in a limited area such as a home, school, office building, or campus.
2.A LAN is usually administered by a single organization or individual. Administrative control is enforced at the network level and governs the security and access control policies.
3.LANs provide high-speed bandwidth to internal end devices and intermediary devices, as shown in the figure.

WAN:1)WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents.
2)WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
3)WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.

Intranet is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization. An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization.


*1. A LAN provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area.
2.An extranet provides secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organization’s data.
3.A WAN provides access to other networks over a large geographical area.*


*there are four basic characteristics that network architects must address to meet user expectations:

- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- Security


**Redundant connections allow for alternative paths if a device or a link fails. The user experience is unaffected.**

**As data, voice, and video content continue to converge onto the same network, QoS becomes a primary mechanism for managing congestion and ensuring reliable delivery of content to all users.**

Congestion occurs when the demand for bandwidth exceeds the amount available. Network bandwidth is measured in the number of bits that can be transmitted in a single second, or bits per second (bps).

*1. Scalability happens when designers follow accepted standards and protocols.  
2.Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are requirements of security.  
3.QoS means that a router will manage the flow of data and voice traffic, giving priority to voice communications.  
4.Redundancy is an example a fault-tolerant network architecture*
