NIC= Network Interface Card (usually physically connects to the end devices)
physical port= media connect to the end devices.
Interface=specialized port on a networking device that connect to individual networks.

**The terms port and interface are often used interchangeably.

-physical topology diagram-(one can see that the rooms in which these devices are located are labelled in this physical topology.)
-logical topology diagram-(one can see which end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.)

*1. A NIC is a specialized port on a networking device that connects to individual networks.
2. An interface physically connects the end device to the network.
3. The logical topology lets you see which end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.
4. The physical topology lets you see the actual location of intermediary devices and cable installation.*


LAN:1.LANs interconnect end devices in a limited area such as a home, school, office building, or campus.
2.A LAN is usually administered by a single organization or individual. Administrative control is enforced at the network level and governs the security and access control policies.
3.LANs provide high-speed bandwidth to internal end devices and intermediary devices, as shown in the figure.

WAN:1)WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents.
2)WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
3)WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.
