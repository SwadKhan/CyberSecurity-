The calculation of estimated Round-Trip Time (RTT) and its deviation in TCP involves a series of equations used to dynamically adapt to network conditions. The primary equation for estimating RTT is:

EstimatedRTT=(1−α)×EstimatedRTT 
prev
​
 +α×SampleRTT

This formula uses a smoothing factor $\alpha$ (typically set to 0.125) to weight the new sample RTT against the previous estimated RTT, allowing the protocol to respond to changes in network delay while maintaining stability.

To track the variability of RTT, the deviation is calculated as:

DevRTT=(1−β)×DevRTT 
prev
​
 +β×∣SampleRTT−EstimatedRTT∣

Here, $\beta$ (commonly set to 0.25) acts as a smoothing factor for the deviation, determining how quickly the deviation estimate responds to changes in the difference between the sample RTT and the estimated RTT.

The timeout interval is then derived from these values:

timeout=EstimatedRTT+4×DevRTT

This timeout value is used to determine when a segment should be retransmitted if an acknowledgment is not received within the expected time.
 The sequence of calculations must be performed in the order listed, as each subsequent value depends on the previously calculated one.
 Sample RTT values are typically obtained by measuring the time between sending a segment and receiving its acknowledgment, with the possibility of using every acknowledgment as a sample when the TCP timestamp option is enabled.
