Mac Address- **48 bits** like -`00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
There’s also a newer format called EUI-64, which is 64 bits (8 bytes), but it’s less common and mostly used in IPv6.

First 24 bits (3 bytes) → OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)

Assigned by IEEE.

Identifies the manufacturer/vendor of the device.

Example: 00:1A:2B might belong to Cisco, HP, Intel, etc.

Last 24 bits (3 bytes) → Device Identifier (NIC-specific)

Assigned by the manufacturer.

Uniquely identifies the specific device/interface.


Hub:

Dumb device.

Works at Layer 1 (Physical Layer).

Doesn’t use MAC addresses, just repeats signals to all ports.

Switch:

Smart(er) device.

Works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).

Uses MAC addresses to forward frames to the correct port (instead of flooding like a hub).

Intelligent Device:

Refers to things like a switch or router that can make forwarding decisions based on MAC or IP.

sending data- top to bottom and receiving data- bottom to top.
