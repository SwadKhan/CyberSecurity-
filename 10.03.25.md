Mac Address- **48 bits** like -`00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
There’s also a newer format called EUI-64, which is 64 bits (8 bytes), but it’s less common and mostly used in IPv6.

First 24 bits (3 bytes) → OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)

Assigned by IEEE.

Identifies the manufacturer/vendor of the device.

Example: 00:1A:2B might belong to Cisco, HP, Intel, etc.

Last 24 bits (3 bytes) → Device Identifier (NIC-specific)

Assigned by the manufacturer.

Uniquely identifies the specific device/interface.


Hub:

Dumb device.

Works at Layer 1 (Physical Layer).

Doesn’t use MAC addresses, just repeats signals to all ports.

Switch:

Smart(er) device.

Works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).

Uses MAC addresses to forward frames to the correct port (instead of flooding like a hub).

Intelligent Device:

Refers to things like a switch or router that can make forwarding decisions based on MAC or IP.

sending data- top to bottom and receiving data- bottom to top.

8.1.7 Check Your Understanding - IP Characteristics
1. Transport layer PDUs, called segments, are encapsulated at the network layer by IPv4 and IPv6 into packets.
2. The data link layer receives IP packets from the network layer and encapsulates them for transmission over the medium.
3. Fragmentation is the process of splitting up IP packets to travel over a medium with a smaller MTU.
4. Best effort delivery does not guarantee packets will be delivered to the destination.

8.2.4 Check Your Understanding - IPv4 Packet
1. The IP header fields that identify where the packet originated and where it is going are Source IP Address and Destination IP Address.
2. The source and destination IP addresses in the IP packet do not change in route from source to destination.
3. The Header Checksum field in an IPv4 header is used to detect corrupt packets.
4. The protocol field identifies the upper layer protocol that is carried inside the IP packet. Common protocols are TCP, UDP, and ICMP.


8.3.6 Check Your Understanding - IPv6 Packet

1. IPv4 was standardized in the 1980s and has several technological limitations, such as lack of end-to-end connectivity and a depleted address space.
2. There are several technical improvements made to IPv6, two of which are a vastly larger IP address pool and a simplified protocol header.
3. The IPv6 header is a fixed length of 40 octets and contains 8 header fields.
4. Several fields in the IPv6 header replaced fields in the IPv4 header. For example, the Hop Limit field replaced the IPv4 header Time to Live field.


* A host can ping itself by sending a packet to a special IPv4 address of 127.0.0.1 or an IPv6 address ::1, which is referred to as the loopback interface. Pinging the loopback interface tests the TCP/IP protocol stack on the host.

8.4.5 Check Your Understanding - How a Host Routes
1. A router is not needed to forward packets between local hosts on the network.
2. The default gateway is the IP address of a router on the local network.
3. The commands netstat -r and route print will display the routing table of a Windows host.
