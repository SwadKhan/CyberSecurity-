Peer to peer- In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network.

The advantages of peer-to-peer networking:
Easy to set up
Less complex
Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers

The disadvantages of peer-to-peer networking:
No centralized administration
Not as secure
Not scalable
All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance


*An Ethernet hub is also known as a multiport repeater. Repeaters regenerate and retransmit communication signals. Notice that all intermediary devices perform the function of a repeater.*

- **Interface** - Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks. Because routers connect networks, the ports on a router are referred to as network interfaces.
