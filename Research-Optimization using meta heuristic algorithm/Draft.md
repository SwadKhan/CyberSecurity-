🔐⚡ Cybersecurity + Electrical/Energy Systems + Metaheuristics
1. Smart Grid Intrusion Detection Optimization

Problem: Smart grids are vulnerable to cyber-attacks like false data injection (FDI).

Idea: Use Harmony Search (HS) to optimize the placement of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or tune IDS parameters (like thresholds, sensitivity).

Goal: Minimize detection delay and false alarms while maximizing attack detection.

Comparison: Test HS vs. GA (Genetic Algorithm), PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), etc.

2. Securing IoT-based Smart Meters

Problem: IoT smart meters in power distribution are weak spots for cyberattacks (data manipulation, denial of service).

Idea: Apply HS to optimize key management (cryptographic key scheduling) or routing security in IoT networks.

Goal: Balance energy consumption, security level, and latency.

3. Optimal Cybersecurity Resource Allocation in Power Networks

Problem: Protecting every substation/sensor in a large electrical grid is costly.

Idea: Model this as an optimization problem (which nodes to secure, which firewalls to strengthen).

Method: Use HS to allocate limited cybersecurity resources optimally.

Goal: Maximize resilience under budget constraints.

4. Resilient Microgrid Operation under Cyber Threats

Problem: Cyberattacks on microgrid controllers can disrupt voltage/frequency stability.

Idea: Use HS to optimize microgrid control parameters while considering possible cyber-attacks.

Goal: Maintain stable operation even under malicious data injection.

5. Harmony Search for Energy-Aware Cryptography

Problem: Cryptography in embedded electrical/IoT devices consumes a lot of energy.

Idea: Use HS to tune encryption parameters (block size, key length, algorithm selection) to optimize the trade-off between energy consumption and security strength.

Goal: Provide lightweight but secure encryption for IoT/SCADA systems.

6. Cybersecurity in Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Networks

Problem: EV charging stations can be attacked (fake charging requests, load manipulation).

Idea: Use HS to optimize scheduling and authentication of EV charging, considering potential cyberattacks.

Goal: Reduce risks of overload and fraudulent access.

7. Optimization of Attack Response in SCADA Systems

Problem: SCADA systems in power plants and substations are high-value targets.

Idea: Apply HS to optimize the selection of defense mechanisms (firewalls, IDS, anomaly detection thresholds) in real-time.

Goal: Minimize downtime and maximize system resilience.

8. Secure Load Forecasting with Harmony Search

Problem: Load forecasting can be manipulated by attackers injecting false data.

Idea: Use HS to tune machine learning models (e.g., SVM, ANN) for load forecasting under adversarial scenarios.

Goal: Increase robustness of forecasting against cyberattacks.
