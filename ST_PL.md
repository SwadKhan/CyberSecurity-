### ⚖️ **How This Schedule Helps You**

✅ **Morning = Deep Work Zone** (when your brain is sharpest).
You focus on *research, writing, or critical study tasks* — no distractions.

✅ **Midday = Structured Learning** (CCNA / Coursework).
Keep this for classes, labs, or technical material that needs energy but less creativity.

✅ **Evening = Low Cognitive Load** (language, light review, cybersecurity practice).
Perfect for winding down but still staying productive.

✅ **Weekends = Practice + Recovery.**
Saturday: TryHackMe / online course.
Sunday: reflection, planning, reading — or simply rest.

## 🧠 Productivity Tips

1. **Use 90-minute focus blocks** — no multitasking.
2. **Set 3 weekly goals** (e.g., finish one CCNA chapter, complete one experiment, draft research abstract).
3. **Use “task themes” per day**

   * Mon/Wed/Fri → research-heavy
   * Tue/Thu → CCNA-heavy
   * Sat → skill expansion
4. **Use digital tools:**

   * Notion, Trello, or Google Calendar to visualize your plan.
   * Pomofocus or Forest app for timed focus sessions.

---

## 🔁 Optional Adjustment for Busy Weeks

If your coursework load increases:

* Reduce CCNA sessions to **3 days/week** temporarily.
* Shift some TryHackMe / online course work to weekends.
* Keep at least **one half-day off** weekly (Sunday recommended).
