A [matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/dsa-tutorial-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/#Matrix) is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and n columns, therefore having total m x n values. If most of the elements of the matrix have ****0 value****, then it is called a sparse matrix.

****Why to use Sparse Matrix instead of simple matrix ?****

- ****Storage:**** There are lesser non-zero elements than zeros and thus lesser memory can be used to store only those elements.
- ****Computing time:**** Computing time can be saved by logically designing a data structure traversing only non-zero elements.

A linked list is self referential  
OOP, python
structured language - c, data struct.

read from file - takes linked list as a argument and traverse it to find anything from it using functions.
